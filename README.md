# Pathfinding algorithms
Here you can find info about various pathfinding algorithms and most importantly, here you can understand them. Along with the explanations, there's also some sample code filled with comments so that you can see how it works more closely, in practise.

Here is the list of the algos currently on-board:

Here is the list of the algos that are currently getting on-board:
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A*

Here is the list of the algos that are one day going to get on-board:
- Bellman-Ford's algorithm
